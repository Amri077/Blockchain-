AmriCoin: A Simple Blockchain Implementation

Overview

AmriCoin is a basic blockchain concept that creates blocks containing transaction data and secures them using SHA-256 hashing. Each block links to the previous block via its hash, ensuring integrity.

Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. This script relies on Python's built-in hashlib module for cryptographic hashing.

How It Works

Block Creation: Each block is initialized with:

A reference to the previous block's hash.

A list of transactions.

A block hash generated using SHA-256.

Hashing: The SHA-256 algorithm secures block information, ensuring immutability.

Chaining: The previous blockâ€™s hash is included in the new block to maintain the blockchain structure.

Code Explanation

The AmriCoin class represents a block, storing transaction data and previous block hashes.

The block hash is generated by concatenating transactions and the previous hash, then applying SHA-256 encryption.

Two blocks are created as a simple demonstration.

Running the Code

Execute the script:

python amricoin.py

This will output the transaction details and their respective block hashes.

Example Output

 eli sends 2 AC to jon- j sends 4.1 AC to cat-Initial String
bf21eae8a1... (truncated hash)
 bob sends 3.2 AC to jon- cat sends 0.3 AC to bob-bf21eae8a1... (previous hash)
5c94b7a2f9... (new block hash)

Customization

Modify transactions by adding new blocks.

Extend functionality by implementing proof-of-work or a full blockchain.

Notes

This implementation is a basic blockchain concept and does not include security features like mining or consensus mechanisms.

The hashing mechanism ensures data integrity but does not prevent tampering without additional security measures.
